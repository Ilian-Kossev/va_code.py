The project is a basic function virtual assistant with the following functionalities:
1. checks for active cameras, performs face recognition of the user and stores their name;
2. tells the time;
3. tells jokes;
4. provides information about current weather conditions for cities around the world;
5. performs searches in wikipedia, reads one sentence;
6. plays videos on youtube.

The program understands commands by searching for keywords such as 'play',
'time', 'joke', 'bye', 'goodbye', 'bye-bye', 'weather', 'who', 'what', 'about'.
It helps if the user speaks slowly and with good pronunciation.
The program terminates after the user says 'bye', 'goodbye' or after playing a video on youtube.
The dependencies list is in the requirements.txt file. A necessary condition to run the 
face recognition module under Windows is to have Visual Studio C++ installed: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com
